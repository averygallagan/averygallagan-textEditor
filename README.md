week 19 challenge Text Editor

This week our challenge was to create a PWA that would serve as a text editor. We had to use a webpack to bundle our files. This one was a challenge for me as i could not end up figuring out how to fix a couple of my errors that i was receiving and everytime i would fix one, another thing would go wrong.
